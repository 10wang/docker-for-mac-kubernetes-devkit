# Development toolkit for Kubernetes on Docker for Mac

Docker for Mac (on Edge channel) includes a local Kubernetes cluster which is very delightful for test and development. Refer to the official document ([https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)) to know how to get it up and running.

If you are using Kubernetes on Docker for Mac, some scripts in this repository might be helpful.
